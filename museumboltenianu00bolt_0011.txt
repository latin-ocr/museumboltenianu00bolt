INTRODUCTORY NOTE.

J. F. Bolten's ‘⁶ Museum Boltenianum'’ is so rare
a tract, that in response to numerous requests we
have undertaken this reprint in photographic
facsimile. Students of the· Mollusca will now
have ready access to the many changes of nomen-
clature therein contained.

The entire process of reproduction has been most
carefully carried out by Mr. F. W. Reader, of
Watford, whose labours we are pleased to have
this opportunity of acknowledging. Owing to
the poor quality of the original paper and the
grey nature of the mk, which latter has in some
cases failed to print in the original, numerous
pages have been reproduced more than once
before a sufficiently satisfactory result could be
obtained.

The actual copy from which this reprint has
been made formerly belonged to J C. H. Crosse‚
of Paris; at his sale it passed into the hands of
C. Davies Sherborn, and now forms part of the
Geological Library of the British Museum
(Natural History).
